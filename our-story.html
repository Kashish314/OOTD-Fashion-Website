<h2>What Makes Us Different?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
<p class="long">We are not cut from the same cloth as other retailers.
For starters, we're more about service than fashion.
We don't push trends onto people. Instead, we connect with people one-on-one
to find the clothes that fit their taste, lifestyle, and budget-and we do so with
innovative methods that are unparalleled in the industry.</p>
<p class="long">We value brick-and-mortar and digital experiences equally.
Hosting customers for shopping appointments online to have a box of hand-selected
clothing sent to their door, we uphold a level of service that earned us a place
in the multi-cultural Indian families.<p></div>

<h2>What we value?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="long">
<h3>We keep our sights set on a common goal by committing to these five values: </h3>
<br>
<h3>Customer Obsessed</h3>
<p>Getting to know our customers is at the heart of everything we do and what makes us different. We listen, ask questions, and discover what's important. By knowing them well, we're able to give them our best.</p>
<br>
<h3>Owners at Heart</h3>
<p>We're entrepreneurial and enterprising; empowered to make decisions that impact the business, our customers, and each other. We take our goals, growth, and success very personally.</p>
<br>
<h3>Curious and Everchanging</h3>
<p> We got to where we are today by breaking rules and disrupting the status quo. Pushing limits and asking "what if..." is in our DNA. That's why we're always looking for the next great idea.</p>
<br>
<h3>Here to Win</h3>
<p> We are passionately committed, not only to meet the expectations of our customers and colleagues but to exceed them. We cheer each other on as we reach for an ever-higher bar.</p>
<br>
<h3>We Extend Ourselves</h3>
<p>We treat each other with respect and kindness. We do the small things that make a big difference. We create a welcoming environment, helping people feel connected, valued, and part of one community.</p></div>
